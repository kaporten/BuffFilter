BuffFilter
==========

WildStar addon for selectively hiding buffs and debuffs.

Source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/kaporten/BuffFilter).

Released versions are published on [Curse](http://www.curse.com/ws-addons/wildstar/221865-bufffilter). Full addon description can be found on Curse as well.

Double addon registration
-------------------------
Due to addon folder renames, you may see the addon registered twice on the Addons list in-game. The addon still works fine, you just see two entries instead of one.
You can fix the double-entry this way:

# Shut down WildStar completely.
# Uninstall the addon.
# Start WildStar and log in on any character.
# Shut down WildStar again, and re-install the addon.
